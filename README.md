# SpaceFury
## Info
SpaceFury is a videogame I developed in 2016 for a friend studying design. I used it to learn how to use the Unity platform and the C# langage.

## App
The app is available on the PlayStore (https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=m.Fouilland.RoLeX) but the enemies haven't already been used in the app levels. However, the editor is already available in the app.

## Code
The code is available in the folder SpaceGame/Assets
The file "Tableau de bord.xlsx" contains all the informations about the different versions and the local variable used.
